Welcome to Mousebytes! 

This platform is based on ASP.NET WEB API framework in which Angular 5.0 was used in the client side, and .NET Core 2.0 was used in the server side. Angular is a Javascript framework consisting of HTML templates, TypeScript components, modules, and services. The client 
communicates with the server through the Angular services to call the API endpoints in the server. In the server side, there are API controllers which are used by client services for communicating data, and they handle the business logic of the application along with the services and models. All of these elements are connected to the database (Microsof SQL Server) through the data access layer.

The database schema can be found in file <b>mb_script_schemaOnly.sql</b>.
